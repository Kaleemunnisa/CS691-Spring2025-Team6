# TravelGuide - Smart Travel Companion

### Problem Statement

Traveling to new destinations can often be overwhelming for tourists due to the lack of accessible and personalized information about local attractions, accommodations, and events. Tourists frequently struggle to find reliable recommendations for entertainment spots, places to stay, and upcoming events, leading to a less enjoyable travel experience. Additionally, local businesses often face challenges in attracting tourists, resulting in missed opportunities for growth.

### Hypothesis

By developing a smart travel app that provides real-time, location-based recommendations and integrates with local businesses, we can simplify travel planning for tourists while boosting visibility and customer engagement for local businesses. This triangular business model will create a win-win situation for both tourists and local enterprises.
